      <div> My freshman year of college I went on an my first ever international trip to Paris with my rugby teammates. I was immediately hooked on travel, but over time I wanted to start documenting my memories into short travel montages. Fast forward to Christmas in 2015 I received my first ever GoPro and became hooked on travel videography. Over time, I've expanded my videography skills and purchased a digital camera and a drone for more variety of shots. The videos on this site are an exmaple of what I have made from my travels and what I hope to make for you!
